So yeah, I proved this tool for building static websites, as Vercel has been taking weird decisions about the direction of the development of Next.js.

That, and I realized that I just need a full static website, no need of SSR even for the Microblog page, as I don't post daily, I can just redeploy the website, so the last post is rendered.

## Static is the way to go

At the start of the Internet, websites were just plain HTML, CSS and JS, no need of Single Page Application, Server Side Rendering, etc.

Of course, there are many websites that need these rendering strategies, but for a website like this, just static is better.

Less time building, fast load, cheaper hosting, less JavaScript on the browser.

## The cool thing about Astro

You can use any component from any framework.

You can use React, Angular, Vue, Svelte components in the same project, as Astro compiles them as HTML/CSS/JS.

Not only that, but you can use Astro as Next.js too, with the *hybrid* rendering strategy, you can specify which pages you want to be Server Side Rendered. Obviously, if you're going this way, you must host your project on a server.

### In other things...

I'm planning on making videos for YouTube, talking about topics that I think we need more in the Hispanic community, topics like cybersecurity, privacy, the current status of technology, and more.

There are many YT channels in English talking about that, so that's why I'm thinking of doing it in Spanish.

I need to improve the banners of these posts, though.
