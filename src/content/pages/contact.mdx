# Contact

You can contact me if:

- Just say hi
- You want to contract me
- Ask me about a tool that I use or some topic

Please, consider that:

- I won't work for free
- I won't work on your startup idea, and I'll just get equity in return (I can't
  pay my bills with lottery tickets)
- I won't work for you and get "exposure" (I can't pay my bills with exposure)
- I won't communicate via phone number; all communication must be via email (we
  can use Discord, Slack, etc. once you hire me).

## My email

Just change `[at]` for `@` and `[dot]` for `.`. This is for preventing web
crawlers from getting my email:

```
contact[at]juancman[dot]dev
```

## Social media

You can send me a direct message:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juancmandev)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/juancmandev)
