# Resources

Here you can find websites, YouTube channels, courses and more stuff that I
consume or find interesting.

## Programming and Web Development

To **power-up** my career.

### Websites (courses, docs, etc.)

- [fireship.io](https://fireship.io) - My favorite premium courses about WebDev

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US) - Best docs for HTML, CSS
  and JS

Technologies that I use for personal projects and sometimes for work.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - Dynamic and flexible React meta-framework,
  used on this Website

  alternative for Firebase, uses PostgreSQL and is really good if you're working
  alone or you want a solid backend without investing to much

### YouTube channels

I mostly use YouTube as social media, I think there is still good content.

- [Eric Murphy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5KDiSAFxrDWhmysBcNqtMA) - He uploads less videos but I really like his work too.
