# About

This website was first created as a portfolio, but learning about how the
personal website is the digital form of the house tree, I like the idea of going
that way instead of a generic landing with my social media.

This website is in English to reach more people; and in Spanish, because is my
mother tongue.

All content written here is without AI; I don't use it for generating ideas; the
only exception is [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) for validating my
grammar.
