# Contact

## Email

Just change `[at]` for `@` and `[dot]` for `.`. This is for preventing web
crawlers from getting my email:

```
contact[at]juanmanzanero[dot]com
```

You may [download my PGP key](/publickey.contact@juanmanzanero.com-bc93bba27f657fc49730741013ec4a1443f077a9.asc) to validate my emails.

## Social media

If you want to talk about contracting me, you may check my career:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juancmandev)

You may check my GitHub, but I have also my own Gitea instance:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/juanmanzanero-com)
- [Gitea](https://git.juanmanzanero.com/juanmanzanero)
