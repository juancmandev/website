# Contact

## Email

Just change `[at]` for `@` and `[dot]` for `.`. This is for preventing web
crawlers from getting my email:

```
contact[at]juancman[dot]dev
```

You may [download my PGP key](/publickey.contact@juancman.dev-80e0fe0b452a2fb48511be1b9fb094f3c57bae57.asc) to validate my emails.

## Social media

If you want to talk about contracting me, you may check my career:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juancmandev)

You may check my GitHub, but I have also my own Gitea instance:
