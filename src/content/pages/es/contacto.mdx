# Contacto

You can contact me if:

- You want me to work
- Just say hello

Please consider that **I don't**:

- Work for free
- Work on your startup idea and just get equity in return (I can't pay my bills
  with lottery tickets)
- Work for you and get "exposure" (I can't pay my bills with exposure)
- Communicate via phone number; all communication must be via email (we can use
  Discord, Slack, etc. once you hire me).

## My email

Just change `[at]` for `@` and `[dot]` for `.`. This is for preventing web
crawlers from getting my email:

```
contact[at]juancman[dot]dev
```

## Social media

You can send me a direct message:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juancmandev)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/juancmandev)
